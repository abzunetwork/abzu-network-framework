MATHEMATICAL GUARANTEES:

Identity System:
  N_id = BLAKE3(ed25519_pubkey) ∈ {0,1}^256
  (N_high, N_low) split for BN254 compatibility where both < 2^128

Content Addressing:
  R_cid = BLAKE3(chunk_0 || chunk_1 || ... || chunk_n)
  Chunk size = 4MB with Bao incremental verification

EWMA Favor Scoring:
  α = 2/121 ≈ 0.0165 (smoothing factor)
  Window = 120 samples over 30 minutes
  Threshold = 2500 minimum score for shard hosting
  Dimensions: [Uptime, Latency, Bandwidth, Storage, Geo-diversity]

Health State Machine:
  Alive (0-2 missed) → Suspect (3-4) → Dying (5-7) → AbsoluteDead (8+)

Zero-Knowledge Slashing:
  Public: {t_chain, H_accused, H_att_1, H_att_2, H_att_3}
  Private: {Reporter_IP, N_high, N_low, nonces, AS_numbers, timestamps}
  Constraints: Target binding, BGP diversity, time bounds, attempt integrity

Cryptoeconomic Security:
  Escrow_ID = keccak256(Payer || Root_CID || Block_Number)
  Prevents mempool front-running through CID binding

Use Cases:
  - Censorship-resistant content distribution
  - Disaster-resilient information systems
  - Offline-first decentralized applications
  - Privacy-preserving data storage
  - Military-grade secure communications

SECURITY PROPERTIES:

Cryptographic:
  - Ed25519 digital signatures for authentication
  - BLAKE3 content integrity verification
  - Noise protocol encrypted transport
  - Zero-knowledge proofs reveal no private data
  - Poseidon hash security for BN254 circuits

Network:
  - Sybil resistance through stake collateral requirements
